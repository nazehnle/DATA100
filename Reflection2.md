### Below is my reflection on "Big Data, new epistemologies and paradigm shifts" by Rob Kitchin:
#### Data-driven science is the future; however, I would be amiss to not criticize the notion that it – in broader terms, exploratory science – will be the fourth paradigm. Sifting through data with the sole purpose of finding correlations is a dangerous game to play. Data collection should reflect the questions and hypotheses one wishes to answer and test. Otherwise, subtle factors may exponentially alter results. I predict that exploratory science will be adopted by most social scientists but will not gain nearly as much traction within the physical sciences. I also envision the abuse of exploratory science in politics. Biases will be present in every study and thus the trivial, back-and-forth arguments will continue. That said, data-driven science nonetheless screams potential when paired effectively with the scientific method. I am by no means a mindless supporter of the scientific method and in fact would rather see a fluid relationship between it and big data analysis. Yet, with more fluidity arise more discrepancies when incentives are not in alignment with fact-seeking (e.g., in politics). 
#### Big data is everywhere nowadays. Thus, it comes without surprise that new analytical and measurement techniques have been proposed in order to better handle massive inflows of data. Advanced algorithms promise the ability to find correlations within data sets. In the article, it was referenced that a retail store increased its revenue 16% per shopping cart after discovering there was a correlation between the consumption of two unlike goods and subsequently placing them next to each other on the shelf. There was no hypothesis that these two goods were bought together. The algorithm brought to attention a correlation that would otherwise most likely go unnoticed. Therefore, such algorithms could prove extremely beneficial for businesses (with the singular goal of increasing profits). 
#### There is a tendency to put too much faith in the algorithms alone (see first paragraph). For instance, a data mining and visualization software, Ayasdi, strives to perform without humans and therefore eliminate biases. In other words, it is attempting to be full automated – a clear violation of what Blumenstock argued in his article. Ayasdi fails to recognize that the four tenets it was built upon are intrinsically faulty. Thus, no algorithm can stand purely on its own when conducting research. The algorithm must be accompanied by data scientists, other experts, and the scientific method in order to perform interdisciplinary research with valid results. As a result, data science is bringing together experts from many different areas of scholarship and encouraging new ways of thought. These new ways of thought contribute to a better understanding of the complexities of human development.
