#### Below is my reflection on Owen Barder's lecture on development and complexity:

###### Amartya Sen defines development to include freedoms in addition to economic success, growth, and welfare. Owen Barder extends this definition of development as a property of economic and social systems, not the sum of improvements made in the well-being of citizens and national output. The latter sum is certainly more intuitive, and that is due to human nature. It is in our nature to process the world around us linearly. Think of every time travel movie to exist. The plot always deals with completing some act that should fix something in the future but rarely, if ever, succeeds when the main character returns to the future. On paper, the act seems to be a direct cause of whatever it is that went wrong, however feedback loops are always lurking. Our world is non-linear with linear exceptions, not the other way around. The toaster project in the video is merely a segue to discussing the previous statement.
###### It is clear that development is achieved through the establishment of positive feedback loops. However, for there to only exist positive feedback loops when it comes to development is a vast oversimplification. For the sake of comparison, let us look at the stock market. The stock market is a classic example of complexity and adheres to chaos theory. It has a net positive trend on the economy over time (in fact there is a strong correlation between nations having a successful economy and having a stock market), yet it experiences negative feedback loops. Thus, the nations in which development is occurring have a similar construction to the stock market. The positive feedback loops trump the negative feedback loops, producing a relatively stable net positive trend over longer periods of time. Steve Jones utilized positive feedback loops in the reconstruction of the nozzle at uni-lever in a way that resembled evolution. Evolution, moreso coevolution, are areas of interest in complexity and chaos theory.
###### This brings us to the last 50 years of development. Many explanations have been proposed for the inequalities among nations and rapid global progress, yet there may never be an actual answer. Using complexity and chaos theory as the so-called missing ingredient is a shortcut albeit a salient topic for anyone who wish to understand the world in any sense. Complexity and chaos theory lay at the core of everything. It is very unlikely that there is a singular missing ingredient when it comes to explaining the ins and outs of development. It is more likely that there are many factors, some of which seemingly far-removed, that are enhanced by feedback loops. That said, the policies Barder proposes are broad enough to allow movement for different circumstances, and narrow enough to be helpful as a guide for beginning the process of development.
