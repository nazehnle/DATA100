#### Reflection on Geoff West's Scale: The Universal Laws of Life and Death in Organisms, Cities and Companies: 

###### As Stephen Hawking predicted, this century will be defined by breakthroughs in the science of complexity. Geoff West internalized the abovementioned prediction and looked at human development through the lens of complexity in his novel, Scale: The Universal Laws of Life and Death in Organisms, Cities and Companies. He discovered that the components of cities obey power laws (cities in the same country, that is) as functions of their size. In other words, cities are complex and adaptive systems. They have a life of their own in a sense – that sense being they are not merely the sum of their composites. Such a discovery is salient from a practical standpoint in that cities are a measurement of human development. Moreover, cities are the home of most of humanity’s social and economic networks. Spoiler alert: both of which are complex and adaptive systems, as well.
###### West introduces the significance of scale by referencing biological research into mammals. There are two such examples he revisits frequently: metabolism and cardiovascular makeup, both as functions of the size of the mammal. He notes that both adhere to a power law. At our most basic components there is a symmetry, a simplicity so to speak, that ultimately encodes us. It goes without saying, we are complex and adaptive creatures. Components of cities such as infrastructure, GDP, etc. also follow power laws as functions of city size. Thus, by investigating scale we have been able to recognize patterns that simplify complex systems such as ourselves and cities. Furthermore, examining the relationships of city components and city size allows us to better understand human development – specifically socioeconomic activity.
###### The use of theory alongside big data is the path forward for analyzing human development, according to West. He appears correct considering that the invention of big data has led to us noticing such power laws. The power laws are hinting at something much greater than humans. Theory must follow if we are to truly understand.
